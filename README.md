This is my automation code as a player in the game "Stone Story" RPG game.

- Reduces death rate to 0% in targeted levels, allowing item farming to inventory limit.
- Maximizes artifacts performance to instant use upon cooldown and specified conditions.
    - Maximizes artifact skill-farming
    - Improves player performance by automatic item swapping, bypassing item slot capacity.
- Reduced manual control need significantly in explored levels.

For more info, check the game in App Store, or their website: "StoneStoryRPG.com/stonescript" ^ v ^

Note that this was a game DSL "Stonescript", so it was added as txt.
